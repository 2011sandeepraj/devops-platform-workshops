# Lab Setup
Prior to working on labs, the Platform Services team will have created 4
projects: 
- tooling
- dev
- test 
- production

One member from your group has been given administrative rights to the projects
and is responsible for adding all other members to each project. 

---
Assign yourself a unique name to be used during your application deployments. 
**Do not copy the application names directly from the lab guides** as you are in a 
shared environment with the rest of your team. 

For example, if the lab says to create an application named `app1-[username]`, I 
would create an app named `app1-sstewart`. 

## Lab Requirements
These labs will require access to the pathfinder production environment: 
- [Pathfinder Web Console](https://console.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca:8443/console/)

The environment can be accessed from a web browser such as Chrome or Firefox. For 
users that also leverage the CLI, the `oc` binary is available for download [here](https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases). 
The current version of OpenShift is 3.9/3.10.

# OpenShift Project Folder
The workshop training material is currently hosted out of the `Lab` cluster inside of the `devops-platform-workshops` project. 

# Workshop Contents and Labs
2 applications can be deployed from this repo, each with their own directory: 

## workshop-labs
This folder has the content to create an OpenShift compatible `GitBook` based application (docker image) that hosts the desired lab content for students to use during a workshop.

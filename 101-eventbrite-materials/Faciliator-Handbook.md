TO DO

## Common Questions

- How long are the namespaces available for?

  I tell the class that the namespace will be available for up to a week. This is manually deleted so it is a bit inconsistent!

## Some Considerations
You will be working with a mixed bag of individuals with a wide array of skill sets. Some may not be
technically trained and may have never interracted with a command line tool!

People will be running the workshop on a variety of operating systems. Most of our lab examples assume you are
using a unix based terminal, for windows users this is not helpful when they are told to run commands like `grep`!

## 8:30 AM - 8:50AM Setup
- Turn on AC to cool down room if its stuffy,
- ensure there are enough extension cords and power bars for everyone
- clean up anything thats not tidy
- Test your laptop connects to the tv correctly 
- Clean up the whiteboard

## 9:00 AM - 9:15 AM Introduction
> Lead Facilitator

Opening Remarks, things to include: 
- Standard introduction (Traditional Territory Acknowledgement) 
- Washroom locations (2nd and 3rd floor of Exchange Lab), 2nd floor has a pw! 54321                                        
- In case of fire, muster point across Broughton, it is in-between the church and the Broughton street parkade
- Lunch is for 1 hour, I like to give the class the choice on when they want to take it but usually it should be between 11:30 and 12:15
- Introduce the facilitators and get a round table intro from attendees (this also helps to identify the technical skills  spectrum)                                                     
- Ask the class if they have specific learning goals and write them on the board, if they are within scope and you have time try and include them into the workshop:)
- Talk about what they can expect to learn out of the course, this is essentially verbatum from the event brite description
- Talk about the workshop structure, lectures in the morning and labs in the afternoon (day 2 is mostly labs)


## 9:15AM to [however long this takes] Tools setup
>You will need to ensure all attendees are set up for success. They require:
> - access to Rocketchat and join the OCP 101 channel for your course. 
> - a Github Account with 2FA enabled, if anyone doesn't have 2FA, demonstrate how to enable it. 
> - They should be a member of BCDevOps Github Organization
> - They should have `oc cli` at the correct version (right now that is 3.11). Demonstrate how to check version with `oc version`

> Lead Facilitator
- Demonstrate how to access rocketchat at https://chat.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca. Explain how this is one of our
sources for community and information. It's thriving and the members list is increasing daily :) ! 
- Demonstrate how to find the OCP 101 channel they will be working from. If you haven't already, post all the helpful links
that are noted in the [101-Prereqs document](../101-Prerequisites.md)
- Ask all attendees to post their Github ID into the rocket chat channel. This will allow your co facilitaor to check their github ids against the BCDevOps Org and add them to it if needed. 
- Demonstrate opening up the command terminal for people who are unfamiliar with cli's and how to check your oc version (for Windows users they may be using Command prompt, powershell, gitbash, or other tools)

> Co Facilitator
- once students list their github ids in rocketchat, verify their ids are in the github bcdevops org and add them if not. Let the class know to check the email they registered their github account with for an email if they were invited. 
  It is helpful to add a reaction checkmark icon beside their github id message in rocketchat when completed
